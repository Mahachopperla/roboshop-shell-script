**Pre-requisites to run script that interacts with aws console**

to connect to aws using cmnd line we need to install aws cli in target machine
where we run script from github

so in linux machine install aws cli (take steps from google)

once installed u should configure using below cmnd

$aws configure

it will ask for access and secret keys and default region

get those keys from aws console->IAM -> users ->create user(only for cmd login dont
assign console login to user) ->policies(admin access)-> create user

once user is created ->click on user -> create access key -> CLI -> create access key
-> copy your access and secret keys and save it safely


Now login to linux machine in which u want to run script to create instances

there if aws cli is already installed continue to configure

else
install cli first and then configure

$aws configure

give requested details
 once u provided details then

$aws s3 ls -> to check connection established or not(if it doesn't give output also it's fine but it shouldn't show error)

once connection established you can write script

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To write scripts we should aware of manual process of what to do

for roboshop what we did initially

1. create 11 instances
2. rename them
3. update r53 record
	if( instance is frontend )
		update public ip to record
	else
		update private ip to record

now we need to write script for this

for creating instances what we need -> AMI ID, security group id, subnet id(optional)
get these details from aws console

to create /update dns records we need -> zone id and domain name
get these details from route53

to install instances and update dns records u will have script in google..get the code and modify as 
u need
